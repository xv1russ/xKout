xKout Rules
===========

Pre-game
-------

1. Dealer is chosen.
  - This is done randomly.
2. Dealer shuffles cards.
  - The game will actually do this, we are talking about real-life rules.
3. Dealer deals cards counter clockwise.
  - Each person gets exactly 9 cards.
4. Dealer asks people if they want to go for 6 or not. (also counter
   clockwise)
  - that means that his team need to get 6 eats.
5. If someone does go, people after him are asked if they want to go
higher.
  - If no one goes, the dealer must choose go for 5.
6. The person who went must choose the trump suite

Round
-----

1. The person next to the person who goes must start the play
2. People play in a counter-clockwise fashion until the last person plays
  - The team of the person who played the largest card eats that round
3. Once the team of the person who went reaches the number of eats they went,
they win the round, if the opposing team reaches the number of eats subtracted
from 9, then they win the round.

Scoring
-------

- The team that wins a round gets points equal to double the amount of eats
that were required by the other team assuming the other team are the ones that
went, unless this is the first round of the kout.
  - 5's don't double
- If a team goes, and they win, they are awarded points equal to the amount
of eats they were required.
- The first team to reach 54 points wins the kout.

Card Strength
-------------
- The weakest cards are all suites that aren't either the suite of the
starting suite or the trump suites
- Then cards for the starting suite going from 2 to 10, then J, Q, K, A
- The trump suite cards are stronger than all starting suite cards
following the same order of strength
- The jokers are stronger than everything, the red joker being the stronger of
the two
  - The black joker is to be played in the first three rounds, if not, then it
  becomes worthless, unless you play the red joker first
  - The red joker is to be played only after the black joker, unless you have
  both of them
